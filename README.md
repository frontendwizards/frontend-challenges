## üéØ Use Cases

- üë®‚Äçüíº Employers evaluating frontend developer skills through UI challenges.
- üë©‚Äçüíª Frontend/JavaScript developers seeking practice with coding challenges.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

Let's say you want to work on the traffic light challenge.

You can create a new project or use our CLI tool to use the starter template.

### üîß First Time Setup

```bash
# Clone repository and setup CLI tool (only needed once)
git clone https://github.com/frontendwizards/frontend-challenges.git

cd frontend-challenges/challenge-cli

npm install

npm link
```

### üö¶ Start Working

```bash
# Navigate to the root of the repository
cd ..

# Create new project from template (run it at the root of the repository)
challenge-cli start "traffic-light"

# Navigate to project and start development
cd problems/traffic-light/solutions/my-solution

npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> The starter template includes React and necessary tooling to get you started quickly.

## üîç How to Review Your Solution

### ‚ôø Accessibility Testing with axe-core

The starter template comes with [axe-core](https://larsmagnus.co/blog/how-to-test-for-accessibility-with-axe-core-in-next-js-and-react) pre-integrated. To use it:

1. üîç Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. üìù Check the Console tab while using your app
3. üõ†Ô∏è Review and fix accessibility errors that appear (ignore minor errors)

### üîÑ Manual Testing

- ‚å®Ô∏è Test your app with keyboard navigation (if applicable)
- üîä Add appropriate ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Review

You can use [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) for a final accessibility & quality check:

```text
Review my code for accessibility and best practices:

- Point out critical issues that must be fixed (if any)
- Rate the overall implementation (e.g., production-ready, needs work, etc.)

Here's my code:
