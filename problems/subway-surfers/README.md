# Subway Surfers Challenge (Work in progress)

## Problem Description

In this challenge, you'll create a simple endless runner 2D game inspired by Subway Surfers. The player character will be moving in a 2D world and will be able to move up and down between lanes (or tracks). The main objective is to avoid obstacles to stay alive as long as possible.

The game will feature:

- A character that can move between multiple lanes
- Randomly generated obstacles that the player must avoid
- Increasing difficulty over time

The player controls the character by pressing keys to move between lanes. The game ends when the player collides with an obstacle.

## What You Will Learn

You will have fun while learning:

- 🎮 **Game Speed** :
  Making your game run smoothly at 60 FPS

- 🏃‍♂️ **Multiple Events** :
  Handling many things happening at the same time

- ⌨️ **Controls** :
  Making the game respond quickly to player inputs

- 🎯 **Game States** :
  Switching between playing, game over, and restart

- 💥 **Hitting Objects** :
  Making sure collisions feel fair and fun

- 🎨 **Animations** :
  Making characters and objects move smoothly

- 🎲 **Difficulty** :
  Making the game get harder over time

- 🎵 **Sounds** :
  Adding fun sound effects to the game

- 📊 **Score** :
  Keeping track of the player score

- 🎨 **Looks** :
  Making the game look nice and fun to play

## Requirements

### Create a 2D endless runner game with:

- A character that can move between lanes (minimum 3 lanes)
- Randomly generated obstacles that appear at different lanes
- Collision detection between the player and obstacles
- Game over screen when player collides with an obstacle

### Basic controls:

- Up/Down arrow keys to move between lanes
- Alternatively, you can use other intuitive controls

### Game mechanics:

- The game speed should gradually increase over time
- Obstacles should appear at random positions with safe paths always available

### Visual and user experience:

- Simple but clear graphics for the player character and obstacles

## Technology

Use any technology you want, I recommend using Kaboom.js which handles sprites, animations, physics, etc. Kaboom.js is particularly well-suited for 2D games like this as it provides built-in functionality for:

- Sprite rendering and animation
- Collision detection
- Input handling
- Game loop management

Other alternative technologies:

- Phaser.js
- HTML5 Canvas directly
- Unity (WebGL export)

## Bonus

For an enhanced version of the game, consider adding these bonus features:

- A scoring system based on distance/time survived and should be visible to the player
- Collectible coins which will give you more score
- Animated coins that spin or glitter
- Sound effects when the player collects a coin
- Sky and ground background
- Decorative clouds that move in the background
- Health bar that will decrease when the player collides with an obstacle
- FPS counter display (it indicates the performance of the game, slow or fast)
- Game over screen with final score and option to restart the game
- Use your imagination to add other features
