# Twitter Like II

## Problem Description

The basic Twitter like button can be visually dull without animation. Building on the first Twitter like challenge, your task is to add animation to the button. Additionally, implement a like counter that starts at 32.

## Requirements

- Animate the like button when clicked
- Display a like counter starting at 32
- Increment/decrement the counter appropriately when liked/unliked
- Handle spam clicking (rapid like/unlike actions) without breaking functionality
- Maintain all functionality from the original Twitter Like component
- Ensure the component is reusable and customizable

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `LikeButton` component:

```jsx
const [isLiked, setIsLiked] = useState(false);
  
<LikeButton isLiked={isLiked} setIsLiked={setIsLiked} />
```

## Props

The `LikeButton` component accepts the following props:

- `isLiked` (boolean): The current like state
- `setIsLiked` (function): A function to update the like state

## Assets

You could use this background with animated heart frames:
