# Whack a Mole Challenge

## Problem Description

Create a Whack-a-Mole game where players must click on moles as they randomly appear from holes. The game tests reflexes and timing as players try to achieve the highest score possible within a time limit.

## Requirements

- At the start, a single mole appears randomly in one of the nine holes.
- Players must click on the mole to "whack" it, which scores them one point.
- Each mole is only visible for 1.5 seconds. If not whacked in time, it vanishes, and no point is awarded.
- Immediately after a mole is whacked or disappears, the next mole instantly appears in a new random hole.
- This cycle continues until the 20-second game timer expires.
