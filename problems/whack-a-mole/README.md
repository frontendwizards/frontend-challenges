# Whack a Mole Challenge

## Problem Description

Create a Whack-a-Mole game where players must click on moles as they randomly appear from holes. The game tests reflexes and timing as players try to achieve the highest score possible within a time limit.

## Requirements

- The game features a grid of 9 holes and a 20-second game timer.
- Every second, two moles will randomly pop up from the holes.
- Players must click on a mole to "whack" it, which scores one point.
- The moles are only visible for one second before a new pair appears.
- The game ends when the timer runs out, displaying the final score and an option to play again.
