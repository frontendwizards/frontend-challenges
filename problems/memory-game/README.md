# Memory Game Challenge

## Problem Description

Create a Memory Game where players must match pairs of cards by flipping them over. The game tests memory and concentration as players try to find all matching pairs within a time limit.

## Requirements

- The game should have a grid of cards, each with a hidden animal emoji.
- When the game starts, all cards are face down.
- The player can flip two cards at a time. If the cards match, they remain face up. If not, they flip back over.
- The player must match all pairs of cards to win the game.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched. A message is displayed indicating whether the player won or lost.

## Bonus

- Make a timer that counts down from 50 seconds, and when the timer runs out, the game ends.
- The game should have a restart button to play again.
- When restarting the games, the cards should be flipped back to face down.
- After restarting the game, make sure you don't reveal the cards content before flipping them.
